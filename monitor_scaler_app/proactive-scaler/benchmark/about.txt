Model for simple benchmark test 
- generates data like this : 2 windows of (100, 300) and 2 winodws of (1300, 1700)
- fits a model on this 
- tests whether prediction is accurate

This is used for the simple demo spike scenario of reactive vs proactive scaling 
It assumes a traffic of cyclic spikes
