Workload evaluation is very important .. in order to assure efficient ...

The main goal of the presented investigation was to find a performant model for web application workload prediction,
which can be later used by a proactive micro-service scalier. 

The investigation uses different
architectures of deep learning: MLP, CNN, CNN-LSTM hybrid. 



The main
contribution of this research is the application of deep learning to this specific problem
and the comparison with a classic timeseries approach (ARIMA).
