-- the chapter on telemetry for feedback in production
1. use means and standard deviations to detect potential problems
e.g. set an alert when the nr of unauth login attempts per day is three
standard dev greater than the mean ; we expect 0.3% points to trigger (on a normal
distribution)
advantage : no statically defined threshold value

problems with non-gaussian distribution
e.g. monitor download requests for a website

techniques to detect anomalies in non-Gaussian data set: -- Scryer
addresses some shortcomings of Amazon Auto Scaling
- which dynamically increases and decreases AWS compute
server counts based on workload data
- Scryer predicts what customer demands will be based on 
historical usage patterns and provisions the necessary capacity

Scryer addressed 3 problems with AAS:
- rapid spikes in demand : service startup times could take 10 -> 45 mins => 
additional compute capacity was delivered too late
- after outages AAS removed too much compute capacity
- AAS didnt factor in known usage traffic patterns
