experiment with 
100 users, ramped every 30s 
- user = thread, sends a req, sleps around a seq repeat
- fibonacci 30 operation on a microservice
it was run on different machine

if we set SLA of p90rt at around 50ms
then from our experiment, that was obtained at around 5300 reqs in a 30s itnerval => MSC = 176
