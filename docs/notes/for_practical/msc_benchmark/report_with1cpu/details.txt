following script:
startUsers(30);
Thread.sleep(45000);
startUsers(30);
Thread.sleep(45000);
startUsers(30);
Thread.sleep(45000);
startUsers(30);
Thread.sleep(45000);
startUsers(30);
Thread.sleep(45000);

each user sleeps around 1sec then sends req to "http://localhost:8762/api/microservice1/method2?n=35";

if we set p90rt threshold at 2sec then we would have around 15rps as our MSC
