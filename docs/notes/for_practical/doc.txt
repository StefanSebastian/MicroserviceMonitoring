most experiments were optimised away ; apps would just eat more cpu and mem and perform just as well with one instance
than with 2

-- 
try to limit max concurrent req per process 
then starting another service would be useful

Exp1; 40 threads ; sending fib30 request; 4mins
didnt work 

docker :
docker run -e PORT=2020 -p 2020:2020 microserv1

added options : --memory and --cpu ; to restric services on cpu and ram memory

ran the following test:
40 threads sending req ~1/sec
over 3 min 

1 microserv : 1096/1266 avg/p90rt
2 microserv : 384/691 avg/p90rt 

over 1 min the p90rt difference wasnt that great
and measurement was done by profiler ; p90rt reported by each microserv is rather constant - only the time for fibo workload 
however time is lost while waiting in queue

todo : 
perform a msc benchmark ; like existing template, to get a capacity
change sla stats into nr req compared to msc
