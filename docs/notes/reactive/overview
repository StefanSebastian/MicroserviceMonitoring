Performance Modeling for Cloud Microservice Applications
- SLO = Service Level Objective - specifies guarantees for the level of performance, reliability 
and availability
RSR (Request Success Rate) - ratio of user requests succesfully completed within a given time to the overall no of req
submitted in the same time 
P90RT - value of response time for interval T that 90% requests that arrived during T received the response in the given time

strategy to optimize for : availability (keeps resource utilization at 40%), cost(keeps resource utilization at 70%), or in between(at 50%)
dynamic + proactive 
you can define your metrics, or use the default ones, like: CPU utilization disk read/write operations, network traffic in/out

A Review of Auto-scaling Techniques for Elastic
Applications in Cloud Environments - Tania Lorido-Botran · Jose Miguel-Alonso · Jose A. Lozano
- application specific metrics obtain better performance than system-specific metrics (e.g. CPU load)
- some popular metrics : avg CPU load of VM, the response time, input request rate
