- use as target : Microservice Capacity 
nr requests that can satisfy SLO
assumed to be benchmarked 

- hybrid approach : reactive + predictive

abstraction microservice = resource 

research can be :
find a robust predictive timeseries analysis method
design a benchmark with various scenarious (find real usages maybe)
compare with other implementations : netflix, histograms, etc 

TODO find an improvement over existing approaches
TODO find or devise a benchmark test
