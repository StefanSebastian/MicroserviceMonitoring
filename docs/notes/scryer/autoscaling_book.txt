autoscaling = automatically scaling out instances based on the 
resource usage to meet the SLAs by replicatign the services to 
be scaled

benefits:
- high availability and fault tolerant
- increases scalability
- optimal usage and is cost saving
- gives priority to certain services or group of services

scaling during specific time periods:
- e.g. airports

predictive autoscaling
- prediction engine will take multiple inputs such as historical inforamtion,
current trends etc to predict possible traffic patterns
- autoscaling is done based on these predictions
- helps avoid hardcoded rules and time windows, instead the system can autmatically
predict such time windows
