Implementing auto scaling
1. naming server (provides location transparency) - I use eureka
2. load balancer - I use ribbon
3. when to increase/decrease
kubernetes can do it automatically (means using its own stack)

https://learnk8s.io/blog/scaling-spring-boot-microservices
- kubernetes ; with more details
use the prometheus metrics api
specify a metric and some thresholds

https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8818401
does not implement the monitoring component
-> relies on service mesh-enabled cloud environment
Microscaler - name of the app 
some monitoring component gathers data from proxies and stores 
them in a timeseries database
Microscaler monitors performance metrics in a sliding window
when SLA violation is detected in the window
the scaling-needed service starts issuing commands

SLA violation -> service request latency 
Criterion for scaling : service power
P50 - average latency of the slowest 50percent of requests to one micro-service
over the last 30 seconds
P90 - average latency of the slowest 10 percent of requests
service power P = P50/P90
if P90 > P50 * 2 (arbitrary) if P90 exceeds P50 too much ; means about 10 
percent of requests could not be processed in time

list of abnormal services
determine which need to scalein which need to scaleout, using servicepower

determine how many replicase are needed using Bayesian Optimization
given : scaling-needed services + workload

(note check references 21, 22 for machine learning approach)

configs : 
* min/max number of replicas
* upscale/downscale thresholds
* cool down delays
TODO go over the gaussian fc

on amazon web services
scaling policies 
using a function (cpu + mem) ; scale in / out / do nothing

- for the amazon cloud ; takes into account geographical distribution of resources
- uses q-learning 
Action set : remove, add, maintain vm numbers
rewards given by a SLA
Reward = cost of execution
agents working in parallel; make actions, observe the rewards, adjust etc
timesteps of 60s ; each iteration an agent takes an action the gets the reward
