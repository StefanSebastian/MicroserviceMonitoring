RESEARCH ON AUTO-SCALING OF WEB APPLICATIONS IN CLOUD:
SURVEY, TRENDS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS

trend = cloud ; resource for scaling up are virtually unlimited 

regular monitoring ensures - Quality of Service (QoS)
needs to fulfil Service Level Agreements (SLAs)

- importance of autoscaling up/down = COST ($$)

Auto-scaling should follow the MADE loop 
- Monitoring 
- Analysis : reactive + predictive 
- Planning : scaling decisions 
- Execution : scaling actions

Auto-scaling techniques have the following challenges:
- under-provisioning : not sufficient resources
- over-provisioning : too many resources
- oscillation - both

Resource Prediction Based on Double Exponential
Smoothing in Cloud Computing
- use double exp smoothing on time series + WMA apply
- monitor cpu + memory
Tests on CloudSim simulator

Online Self-reconfiguration with Performance Guarantee for Energy-efficient
Large-scale Cloud Computing Data Centers
- prediction with Brown quadratic exponential smoothing 
- reconfiguration using genetic algorithms based on CPU usage 

---
Workload prediction in cloud using artificial neural network and
adaptive differential evolution
- use machine learning : neural networks 

preprocess : extract requests and aggregate into a time unit level 
= a minute level 

X is then normalized in range (0, 1)

model = 3 layered neural network 
linear + sigmoid activation functions

X = [
    x1 x2 .. xn
    x2 x3 .. xn+1
    ..
    xk ..   xn+k-1
]
y = [
    xn+1
    xn+2
    ..
    xn+k
]
predict the n + 1 traffic when we know previous n points
