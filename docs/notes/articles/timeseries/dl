1. problems with traditional time series forecasting 
traditional linear methods ; dominated by ARIMA 
they deal with variations using trend and seasonality 
problems :
* they require complete data 
* they rely on linear relationships
* univariate data 
* usually don't work well in long term forecast 

2. MLP for ts 
why : 
* ability to approx arbitrary nonlinear functions 
* ability to handle noise 
* ability to accept multivariate inputs 
* ability to perform multi-step forecasts 

3. CNNs for time series 
* does not require learn from lag observations
* feature learnign  
however cannot learn temporal dependence

4. RNN 
* temporal dependence 
* cannot process very long sequences

why dl ? ts can be highly erratic and complex 
dl make no assumption about the underlying pattern in the data 

data preprocessing : sliding window with the next 
value after closing the predicted value 

* LSTMs over RNns 
- to use information from the past 
* CNN-LSTMs - to solve the vanishing gradients
* Multi-Scale Hierarchical LSTMs --

pitfall : model that uses value at time t to predict t + 1 
could show good accuracy (because points are close together)
MAPE, R2 can indicate high prediction accuracy even if data is generated through 
a random walk process and prediction is impossible
