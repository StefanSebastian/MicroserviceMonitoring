Autocorrelation - similarity between observations as 
a function of the time lag between them 

Seasonality - periodic fluctuations 
e.g. daily

Stationarity - a ts is stationary if its 
statistical properties do not change over time 
constant mean + variance

Modelling : 
* moving average - the next obseration is the mean of 
all past observations 
* exponential smoothing - similar to moving avg but 
a different decreasing weight is assigned to each 
observations ; less importance to past obs 
* double exponential smoothing - exp smoothing twice 
- when there is a trend in ts 
* tripe exponential smoothing - adds a seasonal 
smoothing factor 
* SARIMA (Seasonal autoregressive integrated 
moving average model)
- AR = regression of the ts onto itself 
- MA = moving average 
- I = order of integration
- S = seasonality

Level. The baseline value for the series if it were a straight line.
Trend. The optional and often linear increasing or decreasing behavior of the series over time.
Seasonality. The optional repeating patterns or cycles of behavior over time.
Noise. The optional variability in the observations that cannot be explained by the model.

Concerns :
1. how much data do you have available 
2. what is the time horizon for predictions 
3. can forecasts be updated frequently over time 
4. at what temporal frequency are forecasts required
